prior knowledge
- criticality
- copy knowledge from proof tree

rollout policy
- use weighted random choices instead of uniform random:
- different weights for black vs white?
- local reply?
- locality?
- connections?
- avoid loss?

Time control
- quiecense search - if the highest winrate != most played, keep simulating until it is
