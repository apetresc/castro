prior knowledge
- split knowledge factor from experience
- criticality
- virtual connect pattern
- connections, so being connected to edges and corners is good
- local reply is good
  - use weighted random choices instead of uniform random:
    - different weights for black vs white?
    - values based on:
      - empty, direct neighbour, potential virtual connection neighbours, 2nd corner
      - virtual connection points (0,1,2)
      - edge/corner, near edge/corner, empty space
    - analyze games to determine these values
    - a position near the edge/corner defines virtual connections to the wall

Time control
- quiecense search - if the highest winrate != most played, keep simulating until it is
