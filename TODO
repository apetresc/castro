General:
- if cmdline arg is a file, parse it as gtp, then drop to stdin

MCTS
- use weighted random choices instead of uniform random:
  - different weights for black vs white?
  - values based on:
    - empty, direct neighbour, potential virtual connection neighbours, 2nd corner
    - virtual connection points (0,1,2)
    - edge/corner, near edge/corner, empty space
  - analyze games to determine these values
- a position near the edge/corner defines virtual connections to the wall




Heuristic:
- colorness - how black/white a cell is
  - +3 points for each direct neighbour
  - +2 points for virtual connection
  - +1 point for each in second ring
- contentious
  - (24 - abs(colorness))*(number of pieces in neighbourhood)
- order moves by contentiousness
- dead move analysis
