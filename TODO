Set different cutoffs for ring checking to be less blind to rings
- 0.4 for me, 0.5 for my opponent, etc

Build a large persistent tree in some database
- save and reload heavy Nodes between games
- tokyo or kyoto cabinet?

compact tree memory manager
- move old unused elements of the freelist to the front so they get used first? or is it better that they're at the back?
- store a Chunk pointer in each data block, then traverse the freelist instead of the memory
  - remove elements that are outside the generation size, compact the rest
  - compact Chunks that have old unused segments
  - might be faster, but has an extra pointer...

UCT constant = parent value
- if you're doing well, explore less
- if you're doing bad, explore more

Proof number search player
- choose by amount of work spent in a node

Multi-thread PNS
- increment the delta as you go down


tree checkpointing to deal with a crash?

when looking for rings, return the ring length... if len == 6, ignore, otherwise allow
- how to tell if a ring is size 6?
  - if a 6 ring exists but was ignored, adding to the ring will go around the ring and still make it back to the start
    but claim it's a bigger ring...
  - the O(1) ring detection has no concept of ring size, need to check that it's not a 6 ring...
    - only need to check for the 101000 case, and don't need to check anything for the 111000 case

detect ties
- if not using lbdists, use 1 flood fill instead of 24
- keep bits for corners and edges for each colour
- if crossing empty or your own, propagate connections, otherwise don't
- how to go backwards?
- start a flood fill from each corner/edge
  - mark each edge/corner position as reached by the other flood fills
  - skip if it's already reached

PV doesn't take win_or_draw, loss_or_draw into account
final move selection doesn't choos good moves for proven draws

if not keeptree, and the number of non-losing moves at the root is 1, just make that move
- what if the last move is also a loss? should choose hardest loss

any ideas to handle ladders?
- always generate threats?

reuse (partial?) proof trees
- if a move is backed up as a win, it is likely a win under its siblings too
- give it a bonus to its equivalent cousins
- can we try to prove siblings by reusing the proof tree?
- store which sibling was used to prove the current tree, to avoid having to store it

Test the accuracy of the rollouts
- do a tree search to get a value of a position
- run 1000 rollouts without a tree search to get the value of the position
- compare the two for many positions
- compare at various stages in a game
- test different rollout policies to minimize error
- look at error distribution
- error and absolute error

Test accuracy of knowledge
- do a tree search with exploration to get the value of a position and the order of moves
- try various knowledge combinations to see how they order moves
- consider equal knowledge value when determining distance

multiple rollouts per simulation
- GPU rollouts for those that don't care about rings?


fix crash after last move, seems to be related to pondering



move ordering by knowledge
- lower bound on distance to edges/corners
- maybe based on number of paths? handles virtual connections


reimplement O(1) ring detection
- pattern for the normal case
- only search for a 6 ring for the blob case

rework swap
- rave doesn't give swap any time, so useless as a searchable move
- swap can't be changed after ponder is enabled
- waste of time anyway
- crashes when swap isn't a valid move
- new way:
  - only handle in the opening book?
  - maximize over min(exp, 1-exp) on empty board
  - swap if exp < 0.5 after first move

do proven nodes need
- rave updates?
- to be considered in move choice?
- can this be improved by sorting nodes:
  - solved win
  - unsolved, sorted by x,y
  - solved ties
  - solved losses
- how to do this multi-threaded?
  - do sorting during garbage collection?

detect dead areas, areas where your opponent has limited you to one corner or two sides and no rings
- negative knowledge?
- really dead (completely enclosed) vs almost/temporarily dead (enclosed with VCs)?
- still useful to block opponent wins?
- may be related to lower bound on win?

do 2 ply search at node initialization if certain conditions are met
- 1 corner and group size >= board size - 1
- 2 edges and group size >= board size + 1
- ring if group size >= 5
- how to interact with lower bound?

build a linked list of empty moves so the move iterator can skip filled moves
- probably not worth it since the iterator is used so rarely
- could build a doubly linked list since memory in this area is cheap
- more expensive in the solver than the player

final move selection
- what to do when the node with the most work is solved as a loss, but there is an unsolved node with little experience
  - might be an easy win for the opponent
  - take extra time if possible
- fast wins
- slow loss/ties


multi-thread
- different parameters (ie ravefactor) for each player thread?
  - useful for testing parameters at different parts of the game
- solver threads should use a TT instead of using the tree?


share the tree between the player and solver
- add phi/delta to UCTNode
- need way of knowing whether the node has been initialized by the player or solver
- how to deal with areas of the tree that are initialized by the other?
- rave updates for parts of the tree that aren't yet initialized?
- phi/delta as knowledge again?
- thread safety?
- run multiple different solvers? dfpnsab/pnsab
- knowledge for phi/delta


prior knowledge
- criticality
- copy knowledge from proof tree
- locality for friendly stones only
- size of the group
- avoid clumping? penalty for being near many of your own stones
- lower bound needs virtual connection bonus / penalty for crossing opponents VC

rollout policy
- avoid attacking virtual connections
- local reply?
- locality?
- connections?


Time control
- quiecense search - if the highest winrate != most played, keep simulating until it is
- if only one move doesn't lose, stop simulating and just make that move
  - good idea with total time per game, but not per move



Pros of MCTS:
- very general heuristic
- doesn't get lost
- uses previous experience
- easy parallelization

Cons of MCTS:
- slow
- memory heavy
- magic and witchcraft relates to both the exploration factor, as well as developing good simulation policies/patterns.

Pros of PNS:
- game independent
- works well when branching factor is important
- independent of position in the tree, so fast
- different

Cons of PNS:
- linear decay instead of exponential decay
- gets lost since branching factor is very short sighted
- doesn't use much knowledge or past experience


PNS based:
- Add heuristic knowledge:
  - random rollouts as knowledge?
- Keep knowledge for future move selection
- expected win value of a node, then minimize (delta*(1-value))
- take amount of work into account in move selection
- maximize the expected increase of: 1/p2 + 1/d2

MCTS based:
- maintain phi/delta, and add them as an exploration criteria to the UCT formula
- Add thresholds so updates don't need to go all the way to the root
- change updates so it's not a complete weighted average
  - do minimax backup
  - weighted average ignoring solved nodes
    - hard, since it isn't clear what to do when multiple threads are down a node
  - weighted average over the best 50% of work

Hybrid:
- have a few threads start with MCTS, then switch to PNS at some point:
  - once the branching factor is not uniform amoung siblings
  - once the node has fewer than some amount of simulations
  - once valuation is polarized (ie 60%+ or 40%-)
- have a few threads watching a work queue
- share a tree
  - some threads doing each, both expanding and proving nodes
  - threads switch between proof and player based on success
